# G-Mapster

A hack in which helps in cleaning areas in cities.(useful for municipalities).

To try, goto :-
https://g-mapster.herokuapp.com
Upload an image of garbage in your vicinity.

See the status of the garbage at:-
https://g-mapster.herokuapp.com/home

### How to use?
* Take a picture in your mobile where you see garbage or litter in any area.
* Go to https://g-mapster.herokuapp.com
* Click upload and upload the pic
* That's it.You are done.

The location and the image is stored in the database and the admin side(municipalities) can view it on map.
As the number of images from a particular area increases, the priority of cleaning that area also increases.
This is how it works.

git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/g-mapster
cd g-mapster
npm install
```
